PyEnvBuilder - Python Environment Builder 
=========================================
PyEnvBuilder is a python package that can be used to parse a well-defined YAML file and generate a packed conda environment, which can be later deployed and unpacked on different machines that do not require conda/python.

The goal is to allow for more flexible, consistent and agile environment deployments.
